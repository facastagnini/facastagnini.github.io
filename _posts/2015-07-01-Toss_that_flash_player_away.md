Yet another threat menacing billions of users was discovered in Flash Player.

Adobe Systems, who has a [long history](https://helpx.adobe.com/security.html) of shameful security deficiencies in its software, is clearly not up to the task of writing code that can suffice the minimum security required to be installed in our computers. 

After reading Arstechnica's article [Once again, Adobe releases emergency Flash patch for Hacking Team 0-days](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/once-again-adobe-releases-emergency-flash-patch-for-hacking-team-0-days/), I remembered a website that someone shared with me, [Occupy Flash!](http://occupyflash.org).


The internet is calling you to take action. Lets get ride of flash player.
