So a while ago I run across [this](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/buy-a-brick-for-the-nikola-tesla-museum) Indiegogo campaign, and couldn't avoid it... I end up buying a brick for the long awaited Nikola Tesla Museum in the US.

Today I find out that they fulfill **259%** of the $200k goal, raising the impressive amount of **$518,566**!

Now we just need to pick the frase that will be engraved in the brick.
A friend help me and we choose a line of Howard Phillips Lovecraft.

I cant wait to visit [Wardenclyffe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_Tower) and wander around looking for my brick!
